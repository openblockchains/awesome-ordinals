per bitcoin block.

Can it get any more stupid than that?!  Public service announcement -  please learn the difference between data and code - 
code is more like a baby (or a garden) ... a living creature (or ecosystem) ... day-to-day, month-to-month, year-to-year care (and love) needed .... now try to update your code inscribed on bitcoin one time, two times, three times ... a hundred times ... see the stupidity? 
Use a protocol (and data formats).   Anyways,  wen BITCOIN ON BITCOIN ON BITCOIN?    
The new internet? a 500(!) GB database. the possibilites are limited to 4MB per block. get real. 
wen bigger blocks? PS: What is this (open source) code about here -> [ordinals/ord/commits](https://github.com/ordinals/ord/commits/master). why is this code always changing? please STOP now and INSCRIBE!


## Ordinal Javascript (.js) SDK - SOON!  

Recursive inscriptions. check. What's next?  How about an (ordinal) js sdk.

> An idea: OrdScript - an ordinals native programming language that is super efficient in programming size
> (like GolfScript) and Bitcoin Ordinals aware. OrdScript can be run by browsers
>  through a run time compiler in js that is automatically loaded via a recursive inscription.
>
>  o o o
>
>  Bob Bodily comments:
> 
>>  With a JS SDK you get most of what you are looking for:
>>
>> - SDK is efficient because you only have to inscribe the SDK once and it can be loaded into other inscriptions
>> - SDK has bitcoin and ordinals primitives built-in
>> - Safeguards and limitations need to be built into explorers, wallets, and marketplaces anyway, so a client side SDK could serve this purpose
>> - Recursion / compression / calling other libraries could all be built into SDK
>> - Reinscription / sat references for storage and referencing other inscriptions could be built-in to SDK
>>
>>  Network effects, libraries,
>>  and (native) browser support of JS makes any new scripting language a hard sell -

Not using (ordinal) js sdk? Are your recursive "custom roll-your-own js" inscriptions ded? Please, update your "legacy" inscribes.
